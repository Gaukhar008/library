## Description
The project was created for the [Library assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. The app allows to add, remove and update books. In the beginning, an assignment was given to use "objects" and "object constructors" when initially creating the app. Then the second assignment was given to refactor code by using "classes" instead of plain constructors.
